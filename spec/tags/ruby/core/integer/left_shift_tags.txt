wip:Integer#<< (with n << m) when m is a bignum or larger than int returns -1 when m < 0 and n < 0
wip:Integer#<< (with n << m) when m is a bignum or larger than int returns 0 when m < 0 and n >= 0
wip:Integer#<< (with n << m) when m is a bignum or larger than int returns 0 when m > 0 bignum and n == 0
wip:Integer#<< (with n << m) when m is a bignum or larger than int raises NoMemoryError when m > 0 and n != 0
